\item A ladder of length 25 feet is leaning against a vertical wall.  The ladder is initially 7 feet from the wall; but, it is being pushed towards the wall at a constant rate of 2 feet per second.  This causes the top of the ladder to slide up the wall. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How high above the ground is the top of the ladder initially?

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{start.pdf}
{24 feet}

\item Show that the area of an equilateral triangle with sides of length $s$ is $A=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.

The length of the base is $s$.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you can determine that the height is $h=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$.  Thus, the area is $A=\frac{1}{2}(s)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s\right)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.}}

\item The set of points in the $xy$-plane which satisfy $x^2-2x+y^2+10y=-17$ forms a circle.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Calculate $d_{AB}$, $d_{BC}$, and $d_{AC}$.  

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{start.pdf}
{{{1\linewidth}{Using the distance formula, we calculate the required lengths:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d_{AB}=\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y+r)^2}=\sqrt{x^2+(y+r)^2}$
\item $d_{BC}=\sqrt{(0-x)^2+(r-y)^2}=\sqrt{x^2+(r-y)^2}$

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{end.pdf}


\item Use your result from part (a) to argue that $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle.  (This is Thales' Theorem.)

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{start.pdf}
{{{1\linewidth}{We will show that $(d_{BC})^2+(d_{AB})^2=(d_{AC})^2$.  At some point in our calculation, we will use the fact that the circle has equation $x^2+y^2=r^2$.
\begin{align*}
(d_{BC})^2+(d_{AB})^2 &=\left(\sqrt{x^2+(r-y)^2}\right)^2+\left(\sqrt{x^2+(y+r)^2}\right)\\
&=x^2+(r-y)^2+x^2+(y+r)^2\\
&=x^2+r^2-2ry+y^2++x^2 +y^2+2ry+r^2\\
&=2(x^2+y^2)+2r^2\\
&=2r^2+2r^2 \\
&=4r^2\\
&=(d_{AC})^2
\end{align*}
Thus, since the Pythagorean Theorem is satisfied, $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle.
