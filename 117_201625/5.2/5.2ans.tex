\underline{\LARGE{Chapter 5.2: Related Rates}}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Expected Skills:}

\begin{itemize}

\item Be able to solve related rates problems. It may be helpful to remember the following strategy:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Read the problem carefully.

\item Draw a diagram, if possible, representing the situation at an arbitrary time $t$.

\item Introduce notation, making sure to assign symbols to all quantities which are functions of time.

\item Express the given information and the rate that you are trying to find in terms of derivatives.

\item Write an equation which relates the various quantities of the problem. 

\item Differentiate both sides with respect to $t$.  (Keep in mind which quantities are functions of $t$ and which quantities are remaining constant.)

\item Substitute all of the relevant information into the resulting equation and solve for the the unknown rate.

\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Practice Problems: }

\begin{enumerate}

\item Assume that $x=x(t)$ and $y=y(t)$.  Use the given information to find the indicated rate of change.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose $y=3x^5-7$ and $\frac{dx}{dt}=4$ when $x=2$.  Compute $\frac{dy}{dt}$ when $x=2$.

\item Suppose $x^2+2xy+y^3=4$ and $\frac{dx}{dt}=-4$ at the point $(-3,1)$.  Compute $\frac{dy}{dt}$ at $(-3,1)$.

\item A boat is being pulled towards a dock by a rope.  The rope is attached to the bow of the boat and is pulled through a pulley which is 4 feet above the dock, as shown in the sketch below.  If the rope is being pulled in at a constant rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the distance between the boat and the dock changing at the instant when the boat is 10 feet from the dock?

How fast is the acute angle that the plank makes with the ground changing at the instant when the bottom of the plank is 12 ft from the wall?  Your answer should include the appropriate units.
