\noindent SUGGESTED REFERENCE MATERIAL:

\bigskip

\noindent As you work through the problems listed below, you should reference Chapter 11.1 of the recommended textbook (or the equivalent chapter in your alternative textbook/online resource) and your lecture notes.

\bigskip

\noindent EXPECTED SKILLS:

\begin{itemize}

\item Be able to determine the location of a point in space using rectangular coordinates.

\item Be able to find the distance between and the midpoint of two points in space.

\item Know the standard equation of a sphere and be able to find the center and radius of a sphere. 

\item Be able to sketch cylindrical surfaces.

\end{itemize}

\noindent PRACTICE PROBLEMS:

\medskip

\noindent {\bf Problems 1-3 refer to the rectangular box, shown below.  The base of the rectangular box is in the $xy$-plane.}

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the coordinates of the eight corners of the box

\ifans{\fbox{$(1,2,0), (3,2,0), (3,5,0), (1,5,0), (1,2,1), (3,2,1), (3,5,1), (1,5,1)$}} \fi

\item Compute the midpoint of the diagonal which extends from vertex $a$ to vertex $b$.

\ifans{\fbox{$\left(2,\frac{7}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)$}} \fi

\item Consider the triangle with vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Compute the length of each of the three sides.

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{0.8\linewidth}{The diagonal from vertex $a$ to vertex $b$ has length $\sqrt{14}$;\\
The line segment from vertex $a$ to vertex $c$ has length $\sqrt{13}$;\\
The line segment from vertex $c$ to vertex $b$ has length 1.}}} \fi

\item Verify that the triangle is a right triangle.

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{Notice that $\left(\sqrt{13}\right)^2+1^2=\left(\sqrt{14}\right)^2$.  So, the sides of the triangle (which are not collinear) satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.  Thus, the triangle is a right triangle.}}} \fi

\item Compute the angle between the diagonal which extends from vertex $a$ to vertex $b$ and the line segment which extends from vertex $a$ to vertex $c$.

\ifans{\fbox{$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{13}}{\sqrt{14}}\right)$}} \fi

\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the triangle with vertices $A(5,-2,-1)$, $B(7,0,3)$, and $C(9,-4,1)$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Show that the triangle is an equilateral triangle.

\ifans{\fbox{The length of all sides of the triangle is $\sqrt{24}$; Detailed Solution: \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://www.math.drexel.edu/classes/Calculus/resources/Math200HW/Solutions/01_200_Rectangular_04.pdf}{Here}}}} \fi

\item Compute the area of the triangle.

\item Find an equation of the sphere whose center is $(3,0,2)$ and which has a diameter of 6.

\item Find an equation of the sphere whose center is $(4,2,-1)$ and which passes through the origin.

\ifans{\fbox{$(x-4)^2+(y-2)^2+(z+1)^2=21$}} \fi

\item Find an equation of the sphere which contains points $A(1,3,2)$ and $B(4,3,7)$ and the distance between $A$ and $B$ is equal to the diameter of the sphere.

\item Does the origin lie inside of the sphere $(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2+(z+3)^2=13$?  Justify your answer.

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{No.  The distance from the origin to the center $(1,-2,-3)$ is $\sqrt{14}$ which is greater than the radius, $\sqrt{13}$.}}} \fi
