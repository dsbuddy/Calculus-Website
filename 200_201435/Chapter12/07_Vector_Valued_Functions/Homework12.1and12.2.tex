\item Prove the following theorem:

{\bf Theorem:} \emph{If $\overrightarrow{r}(t)$ is a differentiable vector valued function in 2-space or 3-space, and if $\|\overrightarrow{r}(t)\|$ is constant for all $t$, then $\overrightarrow{r}(t)\cdot\overrightarrow{r}^{\prime}(t)=0$.  That is, $\overrightarrow{r}(t)$ and $\overrightarrow{r}^{\prime}(t)$ are orthogonal vectors for all $t$.}

(Hint: $\|\overrightarrow{r}(t)\|^2=\overrightarrow{r}(t)\cdot\overrightarrow{r}(t)$)

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{Suppose $\|\overrightarrow{r}(t)\|=k$, where $k$ is constant.  Then:
\begin{align*}
\|\overrightarrow{r}(t)\|^2&=k^2\\

\frac{d}{dt}\left[\overrightarrow{r}(t)\cdot\overrightarrow{r}(t)\right]&=\frac{d}{dt}\left(k^2\right)\\
\overrightarrow{r}(t)\cdot \overrightarrow{r}^{\prime}(t)+\overrightarrow{r}^{\prime}(t)\cdot \overrightarrow{r}(t)&=0\\
2\left[\overrightarrow{r}(t)\cdot \overrightarrow{r}^{\prime}(t)\right]&=0\\
\overrightarrow{r}(t)\cdot \overrightarrow{r}^{\prime}(t)&=0

\item Explain why the following calculation is incorrect:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left[{\bf r_1}(t)\times{\bf r_2}(t)\right]={\bf r_1}(t)\times {\bf r_2}^{\prime}(t)+{\bf r_2}(t)\times{\bf r_1}^{\prime}(t)$$

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{The order of the terms matters when dealing with cross products.  The correct derivative statement is:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left[{\bf r_1}(t)\times{\bf r_2}(t)\right]={\bf r_1}(t)\times {\bf r_2}^{\prime}(t)+{\bf r_1}^{\prime}(t)\times{\bf r_2}(t)$$}}} \fi

\item Evaluate the following integrals.

\begin{enumerate}

\item $\int \left[(2t+1)^5{\bf i}-\frac{1}{t}{\bf j}\right]\,dt$

\item $\int_0^{\ln3} \left[e^t{\bf i}+e^{2t}{\bf j}\right] \,dt$

\ifans{\fbox{$\langle 2,4 \rangle$}} \fi

\end{enumerate}

\item  Evaluate $\int_0^{2\pi} \|{\bf r}^{\prime}(t)\| \,dt$ if ${\bf r}(t)=\langle 3\cos{t}, 3\sin{t} \rangle$.  Interpret your answer geometrically.

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{$6\pi$.  The given curve represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 3; this integral gives the arc length (circumference) of the circle.}}} \fi

\item Solve the following vector initial value problems: $\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{d{\bf r}}{dt}=e^{-t}{\bf i}+3t^2{\bf j}\\
\\
{\bf r}(0)=2{\bf i}-8{\bf j}\end{array}\right.$

\ifans{\fbox{${\bf r}(t)=\langle -e^{-t}+3, t^3-8 \rangle$}} \fi

\item A particle moves through 3-space in such a way that its velocity is ${\bf v}(t)=t{\bf i}+t^2{\bf j}+t^3{\bf k}$.  If the particle's initial position at time $t=0$ is $(1,2,3)$, what is the particle's position when $t=1$? (Hint: set up an initial value problem.)

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{The position of the particle at time $t=1$ is $(x,y,z)=\left( \frac{3}{2}, \frac{7}{3}, \frac{13}{4}\right)$.}}} \fi

\item Suppose that $C: {\bf r}(t)$ is a smooth vector valued function in 2-space or 3-space defined for $a \leq t \leq b$.  We define the {\bf arc length function} by $$s(t)=\int_{t_0}^t \|{\bf r}^{\prime}(u)\| \,du$$

This function gives the arc length for the part of $C$ between ${\bf r}(t_0)$ and ${\bf r}(t)$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Compute the arc length function for the helix ${\bf r}(t)=\cos{t} {\bf i}+\sin{t} {\bf j}+t {\bf k}$ which gives the length of the curve from $t_0=0$ to an arbitrary $t$.

\ifans{\fbox{$s=\sqrt{2}t$}} \fi

\item Use your answer from part (a) to reparameterize the helix with respect to arc length. (In other words, express the curve $C$ as ${\bf r}(s)$.)

\ifans{\fbox{${\bf r}(s)=\cos\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}\right){\bf i}+\sin\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}\right){\bf j}+\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}{\bf k}$}} \fi

\item Compute ${\bf r}^{\prime}(s)$ and $\|{\bf r}^{\prime}(s)\|$

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{${\bf r}^{\prime}(s)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sin\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}\right){\bf i}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}\right){\bf j}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}{\bf k}$ and $\|{\bf r}^{\prime}(s)\|=1$\\
In fact, whenever a curve is parameterized in terms of arc length, it can be shown using the chain rule that all tangent vectors will be unit tangent vectors.

\item From the ground, a projectile is shot upward at an angle of $\alpha$ with the horizontal, $\left(0<\alpha<\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$, at an initial speed of $v_0$ meters/second, as demonstrated in the diagram below.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{projectile.pdf}
\end{center}

You should make the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}

\item The mass of the object, $m$, is constant.

\item The only force acting on the object after it is launched is the force of gravity, $g$.  Ignore air resistance and assume that the force of gravity is constant.

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set up an initial value problem which can be used to find ${\bf r}(t)$, a vector valued function that gives the position of the particle at time $t$.

\ifans{\fbox{$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
{\bf a}(t)=\frac{d^2{\bf r}}{dt^2}=\langle 0, -g \rangle\\

\\
{\bf r}(0)= \langle 0,0 \rangle\end{array}\right.$}} \fi

\item Solve your initial value problem from part (a) to determine ${\bf r}(t)$.

\ifans{\fbox{${\bf r}(t)=\left\langle v_0(\cos{\alpha})t, -\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0(\sin\alpha)t\right\rangle$}} \fi

\item Verify that the trajectory of the projectile is a parabola.

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{We can express the trajectory of the projectile (from part b) parametrically:\\
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x=v_0(\cos{\alpha})t\\
\\
y=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0(\sin\alpha)t\end{array}\right.$$

Notice that if we solve the first equation for $t$, we get $t=\frac{x}{v_0\cos{\alpha}}$.  (It was OK to do this division since we had some non-zero instantaneous speed $v_0$ and $\cos{\alpha}\neq 0$ for $0 < \alpha <\frac{\pi}{2}$).  Then, plugging this into the second equation, we get:
\begin{align*}
y&=-\frac{1}{2}g\left(\frac{x}{v_0\cos{\alpha}} \right)^2+v_0(\sin\alpha)\left(\frac{x}{v_0\cos{\alpha}}\right)\\
&=-\frac{g}{2(v_0\cos\alpha)^2}x^2+(\tan{\alpha})x\\
&=-Ax^2+Bx
\end{align*}
where $A$ is the constant $\frac{g}{2(v_0\cos\alpha)^2}$ and $B$ is the constant $\tan\alpha$.  Thus, the trajectory is parabolic.

\item What is the flight time of the projectile?

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{We can find the value of $t$ for which the projectile returns to the ground by setting $y=0$ in the parametric representation of the trajectory.

-t\left(\frac{1}{2}gt-v_0\sin\alpha\right)&=0

\item What is the range of the projectile?

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{To find the range, we need to determine the $x$ coordinate at the time when the projectile returns to the ground.

\item What angle $\alpha$ maximizes the range?

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{In part (e), we have already computed the range to be $\frac{v_0^2}{g}\sin{(2\alpha)}$.  This is maximized when $\sin(2\alpha)=1$; i.e., when $\alpha =\frac{\pi}{4}$

\item Suppose that $C:{\bf r}(t)$ is a curve in 2-space or 3-space and that $\|{\bf r}^{\prime}(t)\|\neq 0$.  We define the following vectors:

\item The \underline{Principal Unit Normal Vector} to $C$ at $t$ is ${\bf N}(t)=\frac{{\bf T}^{\prime}(t)}{\|{\bf T}^{\prime}(t)\|}$.
