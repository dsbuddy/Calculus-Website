\noindent SUGGESTED REFERENCE MATERIAL:

\bigskip

\noindent As you work through the problems listed below, you should reference Chapter 13.8 of the recommended textbook (or the equivalent chapter in your alternative textbook/online resource) and your lecture notes.

\bigskip

\noindent EXPECTED SKILLS:

\begin{itemize}

\item Be able to use partial derivatives to find critical points (possible locations of maxima or minima). 

\item Know how to use the Second Partials Test for functions of two variables to determine whether a critical point is a relative
maximum, relative minimum, or a saddle point. 

\item Be able to solve word problems involving maxima and minima. 

\item Know how to compute absolute maxima and minima on closed regions.

\end{itemize}

\noindent PRACTICE PROBLEMS:

\medskip

\noindent {\bf For problems 1-10, identify all critical points of the given function.  Then, classify each as the location of a  relative maximum, relative minimum, or saddle point.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item $g(x,y)=x^2+y^2-3x-4y+6$ 

\ifans{\fbox{Relative minimum at $\left(\frac{3}{2},2\right)$ }} \fi

\item $f(x,y)=x^2+4y^2-4y-2$ 

\ifans{\fbox{Relative minimum at $\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$}} \fi

\item $g(x,y)=4x^2-3y^2+8x-9y-4$ 

\ifans{\fbox{Saddle point at $\left(-1,-\frac{3}{2}\right)$}} \fi

\item $f(x,y)=x^3-3x+y^2-6y$

\ifans{\fbox{Relative minimum at $(1,3)$; Saddle point at $(-1,3)$}} \fi

\item $h(x,y)=x^2-5xy+y^2$ 

\ifans{\fbox{Saddle point at $(0,0)$}} \fi

\item $f(x,y)=3x+y^2-e^x$

\ifans{\fbox{Saddle point at $(\ln{3},0)$}} \fi

\item $f(x,y)=x^6+y^6$

\ifans{\fbox{Relative minimum at $(0,0)$}} \fi

\item $f(x,y)=x^2y-6y^2-3x^2$

\ifans{\fbox{Relative maximum at $(0,0)$; Saddle points at $(6,3)$ and $(-6,3)$}} \fi

\item $f(x,y)=x^3-3xy+\frac{1}{2}y^2$

\ifans{\fbox{Relative minimum at $(3,9)$; Saddle point at $(0,0)$}} \fi

\item $f(x,y)=\frac{1}{3}x^3-2x+x^2+2xy+y^2$

\ifans{\fbox{Relative minimum at $\left(\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}\right)$; Saddle point at $\left(-\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}\right)$}} \fi

\item Consider $h(x,y)=3\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+6$

\begin{enumerate}

\item Explain why the Second Partials Test may not be used to locate the relative extrema/saddle points of $h(x,y)$.  

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{$(0,0)$ is the only critical point of $h(x,y)$; but, the Second Partials Test does not apply because $h(x,y)$ does not have continuous second partial derivatives in any disk centered at this critical point.}}} \fi

\item Locate all relative maxima, relative minima, and saddle points, if any.
