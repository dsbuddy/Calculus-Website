<p>EXPECTED SKILLS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Know how to use the techniques from Chapter 4.4 to solve optimization problems, i.e. given a system of related quantities, find values of the quantities that optimize one of them (e.g. minimize a cost, maximize a volume, etc)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PRACTICE PROBLEMS:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A rectangle is to be inscribed with its base on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis and its upper corners on the parabola <span class="math inline">\(y=27-x^2\)</span>. What are the dimensions of such a rectangle with the greatest possible area?</p></li>
<li><p>A rectangular plot of farmland is is bounded on one side by a straight river bank and on the other three sides by a single-strand electric fence. If you are to use 3600 meters of wire to construct the fence, what is the largest area that you can enclose? And, what are the dimensions of rectangular plot with the maximal area?</p></li>
<li><p>A fence must be built to enclose a rectangular area of 3000 square feet. Fencing material costs $5 per foot for the north and south sides. And, it costs $3 per foot for the other two sides. Find the cost of the least expensive fence.</p></li>
<li><p>An open top box is to be constructed from a 7 inch by 15 inch piece of cardboard by cutting out a square of equal size from each of the four corners and then folding up the resulting sides.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What size square should be cut from each of the four corners in order to maximize the volume of the resulting box?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the dimensions of the box with maximal volume?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the maximum volume for such a box?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What are the dimensions of the rectangle with the maximal area that can be inscribed in a circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(5\sqrt{2}\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>A rectangular tank with a square base, an open top, and a volume of 108 cubic yards is to be constructed of sheet metal. Find the dimensions of the tank that has the minimal surface area.</p></li>
<li><p>You would like to frame a 27 square inch rectangular print of the Drexel Dragon (as in the diagram below). The top and bottom borders of the frame are 2 inches and 4 inches, respectively. And, the side borders of the frame are each 1 inch.</p>

<p>What are the dimensions of the print which, when framed, cover the minimal amount of wall space?</p></li>
<li><p>A soup manufacturer sells cans of soup with a fixed volume of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. Their soup cans are always in the shape of a right circular cylinder with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and a height of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Find the dimensions of the soup can which uses the least amount of materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the radius and height of the right circular cylinder of largest volume that can be inscribed in a right circular cone which has a base radius of 6 inches and a height of 10 inches. What is the maximal volume? (HINT: Use similar triangles.)</p>
<p><embed src="cone.pdf" /></p></li>
<li><p>A 24 inch long wire can be bent into the shape of either an equilateral triangle or a square. Or, it can be cut into two pieces (not necessarily of equal length) to make both an equilateral triangle and a square. How much wire should be used for the equilateral triangle if the total area enclosed by the shapes is to be</p>
<ol>
<li><p>maximized?</p></li>
<li><p>minimized?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Consider the curve <span class="math inline">\(y=x^2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(0\leq x \leq 2\)</span> and the point <span class="math inline">\(P(3,0)\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Find the point on the curve which is closest to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the point on the curve which is farthest from to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p></li>
