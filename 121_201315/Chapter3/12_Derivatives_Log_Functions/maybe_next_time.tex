\noindent {\bf Review of Log Properties}\\
For all of these problems, assume that $b>0$, $b \neq 1$, $M>0$, and $N>0$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose you have the logarithmic equation $y=\log_b{x}$.  What is an equivalent exponential equation?  i.e., What is an equivalent statement in terms of inverse functions?

\item Suppose that you have the quantities $x=\log_b{M}$ and $y=\log_b{N}$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Rewrite each of these logarithmic equations as equivalent exponential equations.

\ifans{\fbox{$b^x=M$ and $b^y=N$}} \fi

\item Using part (a), compute $MN$ and simplify completely.

\ifans{\fbox{$MN=b^xb^y=b^{x+y}$}} \fi

\item Now take $log_b$ of both sides of your answer from part (b) and simplify.

\ifans{\fbox{$\log_b{(MN)}=\log_b{(b^{x+y})}=x+y$}} \fi

\item Replace $x$ and $y$ with their definitions (from above) and recognize that you have just proven the following rule of logarithms: $\log_b{(MN)}=\log_b{M}+\log_b{N}$.

\end{enumerate}




\end{enumerate}
