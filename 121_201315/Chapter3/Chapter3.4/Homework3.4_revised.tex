\noindent EXPECTED SKILLS:

\begin{itemize}

\item Be able to solve related rates problems. It may be helpful to remember the following strategy:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Read the problem carefully.

\item Draw a diagram, if possible, representing the situation at an arbitrary time $t$.

\item Introduce notation, making sure to assign symbols to all quantities which are functions of time.

\item Express the given information and the rate that you are trying to find in terms of derivatives.

\item Write an equation which relates the various quantities of the problem. 

\item Differentiate both sides with respect to $t$.  (Keep in mind which quantites are functions of $t$ and which quantities are remaining constant.)

\item Substitute all of the relevant information into the resulting equation and solve for the the unknown rate.

\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
