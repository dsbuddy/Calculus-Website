\underline{\LARGE{Length of a Plane Curve (Arc Length)}}
\end{center}

\bigskip

\noindent SUGGESTED REFERENCE MATERIAL:

\bigskip

\noindent As you work through the problems listed below, you should reference Chapter 6.4 of the recommended textbook (or the equivalent chapter in your alternative textbook/online resource) and your lecture notes.

\bigskip

\noindent EXPECTED SKILLS:

\begin{itemize}

\item Be able to find the arc length of a smooth curve in the plane described as a function of $x$ or as a function of $y$.

\end{itemize}

\noindent PRACTICE PROBLEMS:

\medskip

\noindent {\bf For problems 1-3, compute the exact arc length of the curve over the given interval.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item $y=4x^{\frac{3}{2}}-1$ from $x=\frac{1}{12}$ to $x=\frac{2}{9}$ 

\ifans{\fbox{$\frac{19}{54}$}} \fi

\item $y = \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{\ln(x)}{4}$ for $2 \leq x \leq 4$ 

\ifans{\fbox{$6+\frac{1}{4}\ln{2}$}} \fi

\item $y=\frac{2}{3}(x^2-1)^{3/2}$ for $1\leq x \leq 3$ 

\ifans{\fbox{$\frac{46}{3}$}} \fi

\item Consider the curve defined by $y = \sqrt{4-x^2}$ for $0 \leq x \leq 2$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Compute the arc length on the interval $[0,t]$ for $0 \leq t <2$. (Your arc length will depend on $t$.)

\ifans{\fbox{$2\sin^{-1}{\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)}$}} \fi

\item Use your answer from part (a) to compute the arc length on the interval $[0,2]$. (Hint: You will need to introduce a limit.)

\ifans{\fbox{$\pi$}} \fi

\item Confirm your answer from part (b) by using geometry.

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{On the interval $[0,2]$, the curve is $\frac{1}{4}$ of a circle with a radius of 2.  So, the length should be $\frac{1}{4}$  of the circumference; that is, $\text{Length} = \left.\frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \pi r \right|_{r=2}= \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \pi (2) = \pi$.}}} \fi

\end{enumerate}

\item Consider $F(x)=\int_1^x \sqrt{t^2-1} \,dt$.  Compute the arc length on $[1,3]$

\ifans{\fbox{4}} \fi

\item Consider the curve defined by $f(x)=\ln{x}$ on $\left[1,e^3\right]$

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set up but do not evaluate an integral which represents the length of the curve by integrating with respect to $x$.

\ifans{\fbox{$L=\int_1^{e^3} \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x^2}} \,dx$}} \fi

\item Set up but do not evaluate an integral which represents the length of the curve by integrating with respect to $y$.

\ifans{\fbox{$L=\int_0^3 \sqrt{1+e^{2y}} \,dy$}} \fi

\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the curve defined by $f(x)=\tan{x}$ on $\left[-\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{\pi}{4}\right]$

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set up but do not evaluate an integral which represents the length of the curve by integrating with respect to $x$.

\ifans{\fbox{$L=\int_{-\frac{\pi}{3}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \sqrt{1+\sec^4{x}} \,dx$}} \fi

\item Set up but do not evaluate an integral which represents the length of the curve by integrating with respect to $y$.

\ifans{\fbox{$L=\int_{-\sqrt{3}}^{1} \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{(1+y^2)^2}} \,dy$}} \fi

\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the curve defined by $y=\sin{x}$ for $0 \leq x \leq \pi$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set up but do not evaluate an integral which represents the length of the curve.

\ifans{\fbox{$\int_0^\pi \sqrt{1+\cos^2{x}} \,dx$}} \fi

\item Estimate the value of your integral from part (a) by using a Midpoint Approximation with three rectangles of equal width.

\ifans{\fbox{\parbox{1\linewidth}{Below is the graph of $y=\sqrt{1+\cos^2{x}}$ on the interval $[0,\pi]$ along with three rectangles of equal width whose heights were determined by the function value at the midpoint of each resulting subinterval.\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Riemann_Sum.pdf}
\end{center}
Using these rectangles, $\int_0^\pi \sqrt{1+\cos^2{x}} \,dx \approx \frac{\pi}{3}\left(1+\sqrt{7}\right)$}}} \fi
