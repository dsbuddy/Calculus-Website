<li><p>Suppose that a ball is moving along a straight line through a resistive medium in such a way that its velocity <span class="math inline">\(v=v(t)\)</span> decreases at a rate that is twice the square root of the velocity.

</ol></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Definition:</strong></span> A quantity <span class="math inline">\(y=y(t)\)</span> is said to follow an <span><strong>Exponential Decay Model</strong></span> if it decreases at a rate which is proportional to the amount of the quantity present.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assuming that the initial amount the quantity present is <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span>, we arrive at the following initial value problem: <span class="math display">\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \frac{dy}{dt}=-ky &amp; (k&gt;0)\\

<li><p><span><strong>Definition:</strong></span> The time required for the original amount of the quantity to reduce by half is called the <span><strong>half-life</strong></span>.<br />

</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>For problems 16-18, use the results from problem 15.</strong></span></p>
<ol start="16">
<li><p>Carbon 14, an isotope of Carbon, is radioactive and decays at a rate proportional to the amount present (and therefore follows an exponential decay model). Its half life is 5730 years. If there were 20 grams of Carbon 14 originally present, how much would be left after 2000 years?</p></li>
<li><p>A scientist wants to determine the half life of a certain radioactice substance. She determines that in exactly 5 days an 80 milligram sample decays to 10 milligrams. Based on this data, what is the half life?</p></li>
<li><p>An unknown amount of a radioactive substance is being studied. After two days, the mass is 15 grams. After eight days, the mass is 9 grams. Assume exponential decay.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How much of the substance was there initially?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the half-life of the substance?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate at which an object cools (or warms) is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and the surrounding medium. Suppose an object has an initial temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> is placed in a room with a temperature of <span class="math inline">\(T_R\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(T(t)\)</span> represents the temperature of the object at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, then Newton’s Law of Cooling can be expressed with the following initial value problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{dT}{dt}=-k(T-T_R), &amp; (k &gt;0)\\
&amp;\\
T(0)=T_0 &amp;
\end{array}\right.\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use separation of variables to show that <span class="math inline">\(T(t)=(T_0-T_R)e^{-kt}+T_R\)</span> is the particular solution to this initial value problem.</p></li>
<li><p>An object is taken from <span class="math inline">\(350^{\circ}\)</span> oven has a temperature of <span class="math inline">\(350^{\circ}\)</span> and is left to cool in a room that is <span class="math inline">\(65^{\circ}\)</span>. After 1 hour, the temperature drops to <span class="math inline">\(200^{\circ}\)</span>. Determine <span class="math inline">\(T(t)\)</span>, the temperature at time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For the object described in part (b), determine the temperature after 2 hours.</p></li>
